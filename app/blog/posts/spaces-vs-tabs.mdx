We recently hosted an incredible workshop as part of London Data Week, by Jennifer Ding. The workshop was on How Good are Language Models in Global Languages? We brought together researchers, language communities, and AI enthusiasts to explore the capabilities and challenges of AI language models in global languages. The event was a resounding success, exceeding our expectations and generating valuable insights for the field.
Event Highlights
The workshop, organized by the Equiano Institute , Masakhane NLP, and The Alan Turing Institute , it was a vibrant hub of ideas and collaboration. Our diverse audience, ranging from AI researchers to members of language communities, created a unique atmosphere of shared learning and discovery.

Key Deliberations
The first workshop, "Scoping Language-Specific Evaluation Priorities," centered on identifying critical areas for assessing AI language models in global contexts. The discussions revealed cultural sensitivity as the most pressing issue, emphasizing the need for AI models to preserve cultural nuances, particularly in translating idioms and humor. Participants stressed that translation impacts personal and cultural identity, necessitating a deeper understanding by AI systems to avoid losing essential meanings. Language bias also emerged as a significant concern, with discussions highlighting the dominance of certain languages in AI models and the potential marginalization of less-represented languages. Addressing these biases is crucial for developing more equitable AI technologies.

Technological accessibility and community involvement were also key topics. The workshop underscored the disparity in access to AI technologies for speakers of low-resource languages, calling for more inclusive development efforts to bridge this gap. Additionally, community participation was recognized as vital for improving AI models' accuracy and cultural relevance. Engaging local language communities can provide valuable insights and data, enhancing the performance and acceptance of AI technologies. These insights from the workshop will guide future research and development, aiming to create more inclusive, culturally aware, and fair AI language models.

The second workshop, "Data Collection and Management for AI Language Models," concentrated on the essential practices for gathering and managing data, particularly for underrepresented languages. The discussions highlighted data collection strategies as a critical area, emphasizing the importance of diverse sources to capture language variations. Participants advocated for crowdsourcing from native speakers and the inclusion of both written and spoken data. Ensuring data quality and validation was also a significant concern, with rigorous validation processes and the involvement of native speakers being pivotal to maintaining data accuracy and consistency across different sources.

Ethical considerations were thoroughly examined, addressing consent, privacy, and fair compensation for data contributors, especially from underrepresented language communities. The role of technology was explored, with discussions on tools and platforms for efficient data gathering and AI-assisted methods. The workshop also emphasized the importance of community engagement, recognizing the need to motivate and sustain participation from language communities and build long-term relationships. These insights will guide efforts to develop comprehensive and ethically sound datasets, fostering the growth of AI language models that are inclusive and representative of diverse linguistic landscapes.

During our third workshop, participants highlighted several key insights on Benchmarks and AI Policy. They noted that certain languages lack specific words or concepts, such as cardinal directions, which leads to different reasoning and priorities, emphasizing the need to address these disparities for equitable AI performance. There was also a robust debate on whether market incentives or mandates are more effective for creating safe and inclusive AI systems, with a consensus favoring standards supported by additional incentives. Additionally, the need for affective benchmarks, which relate to feelings and attitudes, was emphasized to complement normative and epistemic benchmarks. Finally, there was a growing recognition of the necessity for new models of data ownership that better reflect the contributions and rights of data providers.
